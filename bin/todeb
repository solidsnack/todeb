 USAGE: todeb <options>* <action>? < todeb.yaml

  Reads the ToDeb file to on standard input to take some steps in the
  production of Debian packages. The available actions are:

  If the action is not given on the command line or as part of the YAML input,
  the default action is `#{DEFAULT_ACTION}'. Actions given on the command line
  override actions given in files.

  The YAML input file allows one to specify a plug in just a few parameters in
  order to get Debian package. An example input is included with the source
  distribution. Some fields and some information about them:

    action:
      Action to perform; normally left out of the file but useful for cases
      where everything needs to specified over standard input. A simple way to
      use it is:

       :; cat - some-todeb-package.yaml | todeb
        action: #{DEFAULT_ACTION}
        ^D

      Remember to send a newline before sending EOF!

    name:
      Debian-style name of package.

    version:
      Debian-style version of package.

    filesystem:
      A two-field value describing a filesystem archive to install.

      root:
        Optionally, one may give a glob specifying the package's nominal root
        directory. The tool will chdir in to this directory after extracting
        the archive but before creating the Debian source directory.

      .tar:
      .tar.bz:
      &al.
        A base 16 encoded archive. The name of the field gives the format of
        the archive. Please pick one. Supported formats and their names are:

          #{ToDeb::Archive.supported_archives_statement.join("\n          ")}
